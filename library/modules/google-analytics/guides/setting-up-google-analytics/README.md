# Setting up Google Analytics

## What you will learn in this guide

This guide will show you how to add basic tracking with Google Analytics. After this guide you will be able to collect data on how many users that see your app, some of their behaviors and how they move through your application.

## Overview

We will go through the following topics:

- Beginners guide to Google Analytics
- Set up Google Analytics
- Set up the Noodl Module
- Allow tracking
- Next steps

## Beginners guide to Google Analytics

If you're already familiar with _impressions_ and _page views_ and just want to set up your tracking, feel free to jump along to [the next section](/library/modules/google-analytics/guides/setting-up-google-analytics).

If tracking in Google Analytics is new to you, keep reading for a quick crash course.

The most common things to track with Google Analytics are _visitor count_ and _page views_. These are coincidentally two of the metrics that Google Analytics track by default without you having to take any other action than just starting the tracking script in your app.

The user data lets you know how many people visit your app. It also include a lot of helpful information on the visiting demographics and what technologies they use to access your app. What is the average length of the users visit? What part of the world are they from? What languages do they speak? Are they primarily desktop or mobile users? All of this, and much more can be answered by reading the collected data.

While the demographic data is good for tracking general behavior, page views can be used to see details on specific interaction. What are the most visited pages? On what page do your users spend the most time? Are they reaching that last step of the form, or do they drop off earlier? Where do they drop off?

It is well worth learning more about [finding your way around Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9367631), and especially the contents and capabilities of [GA4 Reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9212670), as they are the backbone of Google Analytics and an instrumental tool in shaping the success of your app.

## Set up Google Analytics

To be able to use Google Analytics you need to have:

1. an Analytics account with a _Google Analytics 4 (GA4)_ **Property**
2. with a _Web_ **Data Stream**
3. pointing to the deployed app URL (or a placeholder one, like `example.com`)
4. with _Enhanced Measurement_ **disabled**

If this list is crystal clear, you already know how to do this and can skip along to the [next section](/library/modules/google-analytics/guides/setting-up-google-analytics#setting-up-the-noodl-module) of this guide. Otherwise - Google has some handy documentation:

### Setting up your Google account

If you don't already have a Google Analytics account you need to [create one](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#account&zippy=%2Cweb).

After that we need to [set up a **Property**](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#property&zippy=%2Cweb), which is Google terminology for "a collection of **Data Streams** that you want to track".

:::caution
Make sure that you are using _Google Analytics 4_ and **NOT** _Universal Analytics_, as this Module only supports _GA4_.
:::

So what is a **Data Stream**? Simply put, it's a connection that will stream data from your app to Google Analytics. You can have multiple **Data Streams** in your **Property**, but in most cases you will only need one.

Let's set up our first **Data Stream**. As Noodl outputs Web Apps, we will need to select the [**Web** option](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#stream&zippy=%2Cweb). When asked for the URL of the primary website, this needs to be the URL for your app when it's deployed. `example.com` works for testing purposes as well.

!> Make sure to disable [_Enhanced Measurement_](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061), as this might send double page views.

## Seting up the Noodl Module

In the Google Analytics admin panel, go to your newly created **Data Stream** settings and copy the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598#find-G-ID). You will be needing this later.

Open up your Noodl Project and locate your **Root Component**. It's easy to identify, since it has a small house icon in front of it and is called `App` (if you haven't renamed it).

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/library/modules/google-analytics/guides/setting-up-google-analytics/root-component.png)

</div>

Create a `Google Analytics Root` node and place it in the visual tree, as high up as you can, then paste the **Measurement ID** that you copied earlier into the `Measurement ID` input in the **Property Panel**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

</div>

## Allow tracking

To be able to track anything we need to check the <span className="ndl-data">Allow Tracking</span> input. This can be done by simply checking the input in the **Property Panel**.

In most cases it is recommended that you notify the user of your tracking and only track after having been given the users consent.

To do this we can use a **Button** node and a **Switch** node. Connect the **Switch** nodes <span className="ndl-data">Current State</span> output to the <span  className="ndl-data">Allow Tracking</span> input on the **Google Analytics Root** node. Use the **Button** nodes <span className="ndl-signal">Click</span> output to flip the **Switch** to `On`.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/modules/google-analytics/guides/setting-up-google-analytics/allow-tracking-with-button.png)

</div>

This will initiate the tracking when the user clicks the button.

To make sure that everything is correct, we can use the <span className="ndl-signal">Starting Tracking</span> output on the **Google Analytics Root** node. This will send a <span className="ndl-signal">signal</span> when the Google Analytics tracking code has been activated. This <span className="ndl-signal">signal</span> can also be used to hide the button after consent has been given. Simply use the same "flip the switch" trick we did above, but setting the **Switch** initial state to `On` (letting the **Button** flip the switch to `Off`) and connecting the <span className="ndl-data">Current State</span> output to the <span className="ndl-data">Mounted</span> input on the **Button**.

## Next steps

Congratulations! The Google Analytics integration is complete! You should now be able to see stored and real time data in your [Google Analytics Reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9212670) view.

Google Analytics is very powerful and has a lot of features, and it's highly recommended to learn more about it if you're just starting your Analytics journey. Sadly, we've reached the end of this guide, but there are many resources where you can learn more about GA4. Google themselves provide free online courses in the [Analytics Academy](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/) that are well worth checking out if you want to learn all the ins and outs of both the tool and tracking strategies. Less in-depth information is also available - one Google (or YouTube) search away.
