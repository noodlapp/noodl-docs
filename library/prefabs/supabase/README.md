### Pages

You will also find a couple of pages that allow you to quickly get up and running with all user features.
Set the `Supabase Example App Root` as your home component for a quick start on all routing.

## Quickstart

First, drop a **Supabase – Setup Client** in your project home component and input your `Supabase URL` and `Supabase Anon Key` in its Property Panel. Then, open the **Projects Settings** sidebar and find the `Head Code` input. Add the following at the top:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2.22.0';

  window.createClient = createClient;
</script>
```

Lastly, you need to connect the `Did Mount` output of your root Group node to the `Do` input of the `Supabase - Setup Client` like so:

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/supabase/setup.png)

</div>

This will set everything up and allow you to use all of the other Supabase components.

You can use an **[Object](/nodes/data/object/object-node)** node set to the id `currentUser` to get all the user data (if a user is logged in).

You can use the **[Supabase – Fetch Current User Auth](./components/supabase-update-current-user-auth/README.md)** component to check if the user is logged in. If the user is already authenticated from a previous session, this session is retrieved, the user is considered logged in, and the component outputs `true` on its `Logged In` output and in the `currentUser` Noodl object.

Use the **[Supabase - Fetch Current User Profile Data](./components/supabase-update-current-user-profile-data/README.md)** to trigger a data fetch and refresh the non-auth data in the `currentUser` object.
