# Reference Documentation

Here you will find the reference documentation for the Noodl Javascript API that you can use in [Function](/nodes/javascript/function) and [Script](/nodes/javascript/script) nodes but also in other nodes such as the [REST](/nodes/data/rest) node, or when creating your own modules and code Noodl nodes.

You can always reach the API using the `Noodl.` prefix, such as:

```javascript
Noodl.Variables.MyVariable = 10;
```
