# Query Records

This node is used to fetch a selection of records from the Noodl Cloud Services backend. You can provide a query to define the selection of records you want to retrieve.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-node.png)

</div>

You can specify the query using filter, sorting and limit in the Property Panel.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-filter-1.png)

</div>

{/*##head##*/}

## Filters

By default the **Query Records** will fetch all **Records**, you can however add a filter. You can choose from a simple filter where you can filter on one or more **Record** properties, or a more advanced JSON based filter syntax, that also can include Javascript logic.

### Simple Filters

The **Simple** filters are created through a UI where you select properties and how to filter them in the filter panel.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-filter-2.png)

</div>

Note that you can select if you want the filter to use a static value or a value that comes from an input.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-filter-3.png)

</div>

### Sorting with Simple Filters

By default the **Query Records** does not return the result of a fetch sorted. You can specify sorting. Like filters you add which properties you want to sort on.

For each property you can choose the sorting order.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-sorting-1.png)

</div>

## Limit

Be default up to a 1000 records are returned. But you can specify a **Limit**, the number of records to return, and **Skip**, at what index to start returning records. This is very useful for pagination when listing records.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background m">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-limit.png)

</div>

## Total Count

If you choose to limit the returned records or if you have more than the maximum allowed return records you can request the total count to be returned with your query.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background m">

![](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records/query-records-total-count.png)

</div>

By enabling this you will provide the total count on the <span class="ndl-data">Total Count</span> output.

## Advanced filters

If you choose _Advanced_ as filter type you will get the option to specify a filter script. This is regular javascript code but you need to end the script by calling the _where_ function with the filter definition provided. This is done using the following syntax:

```javascript
where({
  Completed: { equalTo: true },
});
```

The above filter will return all **Records** in the collection that has the _Completed_ property _true_. You can select from a number of operators:

- **lessThan** Less Than
- **lessThanOrEqualTo** Less Than Or Equal To
- **greaterThan** Greater Than
- **greaterThanOrEqualTo** Greater Than Or Equal To
- **equalTo** Not Equal To
- **notEqualTo** Not Equal To
- **containedIn** Contained In
- **notContainedIn** Not Contained in
- **exists** A value is set for the key
- **matchesRegex** Check if a value matches a regex pattern
- **text** Text search in one or several columns using a text index
- **idEqualTo** Match the id of the item to a specific id
- **idContainedIn** Check if the id of the item matches an id in an array of ids
- **pointsTo** Check if the id of the item matches an id in an array of ids
- **relatedTo** Checks if the item is related to another item, through a _relation_

For instance, to filter on if a certain property (in this example Letter) is one of many possible values:

```javascript
where({
  Letter: { containedIn: ["A", "B", "C"] },
});
```

Or to filter all **Records** that have a value set for a specific property:

```javascript
where({
  Letter: { exists: true },
});
```

You can also combine these filters into expressions using **and** and **or**, for instance:

```javascript
where({
  and: [{ ZipCode: { exists: true } }, { Score: { greaterThan: 10 } }],
});
```

You can also use the **matchesRegex** operator to filter by regular expression, this is generally slow and not recommended for large sets. Learn more [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/)

```javascript
where({
  SomeString: { matchesRegex: "pattern", options: "i" },
});
```

As mentioned above the filter script is a javascript function so you can provide javascript code if you like:

```javascript
where({
  SomeDate: { equalTo: new Date() },
});
```

You can also specify variables instead of explicitly specifying the filter values, this will create an input port on the _Query Collection_ node that can then be connected to. You specify variables simply by using the **Inputs** object. The filter below will create an input called MyStringInput.

```javascript
where({
  SomeString: { equalTo: Inputs.MyStringInput },
});
```

You can also do text search in strings. This will create an index in the database and text search only works on one property so you have to choose wisely. Also text search matches whole words and must be the first filter in an _and_ or _or_ sequence.

```javascript
where({
  SomeString: { text: { search: Inputs.MyStringInput } },
});
```

You can also toggle case sensitivity for text searches.

```javascript
where({
  SomeString: {
    text: {
      search: {
        term: Inputs.MyStringInput,
        caseSensitive: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

If you need to match the _Id_ of **Records** in the collection you need to use the special operation:

```javascript
where({
  idEqualTo: Inputs.TheRecordId,
});
```

In the above filter you can connect a _Record Id_ output to the _TheRecordId_ parameter to fetch just one specific object. You can also request a set of object based on their Id.

```javascript
where({
  idContainedIn: [Inputs.FirstObjectId, Inputs.SecondObjectId],
});
```

Some properties in your _Records_ can be of _Pointer_ type, that means that they reference another **Records** with a specific _Id_. If you want to filter out **Records** that point to a specific **Records**, use this syntax. Let's say you have a collection of _Post_ **Records**, each have a set of _Comment_ **Records** where each _Comment_ points back to it's owning _Post_ via the _Owner_ property. The filter below will find all _Comments_ for a _Post_ given that you provide the post id.

```javascript
where({
  Owner: { pointsTo: Inputs.MyPostId },
});
```

You can also provide an array if you want to find _Comments_ that are related to a set of _Post_ **Records**.

```javascript
where({
  Owner: { pointsTo: [Inputs.MyFirstPostId, Inputs.MySecondPost] },
});
```

Don't forget that you need to send a signal to _Fetch_ to perform a new fetch with a new filter if any of the filter inputs have changed.

**Records** also support many-to-many relationships via _Relations_. <!-- , check out the guide [here](/guides/relations) for more information. --> You can filter our all **Records** in the collection you are querying that are related to a specific **Record** via a _Relation_ with a given key using:

```javascript
where({
  relatedTo: { id: Inputs.MyRecordWithARelation, key: "the-relation-key" },
});
```

### Geo queries

Noodl allows you to associate real-world latitude and longitude coordinates with an object. Using a **GeoPoint** property type in a class allows queries to take into account the proximity of an object to a reference point. This allows you to easily do things like find out what user is closest to another user or which places are closest to a user.

If you have a **Record** with a **GeoPoint** type property called **Location** you can use these queries, first `nearSphere`, it will return results ordered by the distance from the specified `latitude` and `longitude` point.

```javascript
where({
  Location: {
    nearSphere: {
      latitude: 48.0,
      longitude: -110.1,
    },
  },
});
```

You can also specify a maximum distance from the center point by using either `maxDistanceInMiles` or `maxDistanceInKilometers`, e.g.

```javascript
where({
  Location: {
    nearSphere: {
      latitude: 48.0,
      longitude: -110.1,
      maxDistanceInKilometers: 100,
    },
  },
});
```

Another option is to query only records with **Location** that are within a certain rectangular bounding box. This makes it possible to query for the set of records that are contained within a particular area. It's done using the `withinBox` query.

```javascript
where({
  Location: {
    withinBox: [
      {
        latitude: 37.71,
        longitude: -122.53,
      },
      {
        latitude: 30.82,
        longitude: -122.37,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Itâ€™s also possible to query for the set of records that are contained within or on the bounds of a polygon. Opened or closed paths are allowed, minimum of 3 points. It's done using the `withinPolygon` query.

```javascript
where({
  Location: {
    withinPolygon: [
      {
        latitude: 25.774,
        longitude: -80.19,
      },
      {
        latitude: 18.466,
        longitude: -66.118,
      },
      {
        latitude: 32.321,
        longitude: -64.757,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Sorting in advanced filters

To specify the sort order when using advanced filter you run a function called _sort_ in the filter script.

```javascript
where({
  // You where filter here
});

sort(["createdAt"]);
```

The sort function takes an array with strings specifying the names of the properties you want to sort by. You can prefix the property name with "-" to specify that you want to sort in descending order instead of the default ascending order.

```javascript
sort(["-Age", "createdAt"]);
```
