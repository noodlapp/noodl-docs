# Task List App Build Along

In this two parts video series, Johan will walk you through how he builds a task list app. This Build Along is excellent for beginners since it will take you through all of the basic functionality of Noodl.

You can import the full project [here](/library/examples/task-list-app).

These videos are from a deprecated commercial version of Noodl and include some features not present in the open source version, notably workspaces and built-in Git hosting
