# Component Stack Guide

## What you will learn in this guide

In this guide we will take a look at the [Component Stack](/nodes/component-stack/component-stack-node) node and the related navigation node [Push Component To Stack](/nodes/component-stack/push-component) and [Pop Component From Stack](/nodes/component-stack/pop-component).

They are an alternative navigation component compared to the [Page Router](/nodes/navigation/page-router) and related nodes. Instead of giving each **Page** a URL, and making use if the browser back history, **Component Stack** is completely handled from within the App. Both these styles of navigations can of course be combined. In this guide we will combine **Component Stack** with **Popups**. You will learn how to make a little modal wizard.

## Overview

The guide will cover the following topics

- Defining a component stack
- Pushing and popping components on the stack
- Forwarding data between components on the stack and outside the stack
- Keeping track of which component that is on top of the stack (and how many)
- Transitions when pushing and popping components

The guide is a continuation of the [Popup Guide](/docs/guides/navigation/popups) and it's recommended that you go through that guide first. It's also good to know the basics on data in Noodl, so also have a look at the [Object](/docs/guides/data/objects) and [Arrays](/docs/guides/data/arrays) guides before starting this guide. We will also use [Events](/docs/guides/business-logic/events) in the guide.

## Creating a modal Wizard using **Component Stack**

This guide will show you how to create a little "Wizard" type UI contained in a **Popup**. It's a continuation on the [Popup Guide](/docs/guides/navigation/popups). So start by importing the project below (by clicking the Import Button) into Noodl if you haven't finished that guide.

## Navigation within a Popup

To quickly recap what we achieved in the Popup Guide. We had a list of People and we created a Popup that had us confirm any deletion in the list. We also created a `Popup Base` component that we can use to make new nice looking Popups.

We now want to do a wizard style **Popup** were the user can add more persons to our list of people. "Wizard style" meaning the user will move through multiple screens within the **Popup** to create the entry. Normally, navigation in Noodl is done using the **Page Router** node (check out the guide [here](/docs/guides/navigation/basic-navigation)), but this it typically not meant for modal states of the app, since each **Page** have a unique URL. Instead you can use the [Component Stack](/nodes/component-stack/component-stack-node) node which doesn't affect the URL and therefore is more fit for a modal state in the app. It also supports transitions which is nice.

We want our "Add new Person" popup two have three states.

1. Fill out first name, last name and age of the new person to add to the list
2. Select country
3. Based on the country, select city

We also need to think about the data aspect. From the Popup guide we know that each person is stored in an object of this type:

```json
{
	"firstname":<first name of the person>,
	"lastname":<last name of the person>,
	"age":<The age of the person>,
	"location":<the city and country where the person lives>
}
```

The plan is the following:

1. When we open the popup, we create a new **Object** represening the new person
2. The first screen fills out `firstname`, `lastname` and `age` of the **Object**
3. The second screen the user selects their country
4. The third screen presents city options based on the country and then stores location in the **Object**
5. When the popup is closed, the new **Object** is added to the **Array**

Let's get started!

Start by creating a new Visual Component. Call it `Add New Person Popup`. Replace the **Group** node in it with a `Popup Base`. Change the title of it to "Add New Person".
As content in that **Popup** we are going to start with a **Text** node which will be consistent in the **Popup** that holds the current step of the wizard. ("Step x of 3"). So add a **String Format** node with the string `Step {current_step} of 3`.

Then we want our dynamic content that will change as the user progresses through the wizard. Create a **Component Stack** and add after the **Text** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-1.png)

</div>

## Adding components to a **Component Stack**

We are ready to create our components in our **Component Stack**.
:::note

When using a **Component Stack** we should not use **Page** components, since they are only to be used with **Page Routers**.

:::

Click on the **Component Stack**. Click the `+` under "Components" to add new components.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/component-stack-1.png)

</div>

We want three components, call them `Step 1 - Name`, `Step 2 - Country`, `Step 3 - City`.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/component-stack-2.png)

</div>

We are going to need to create components for each of these components. To keep better track of them we will put them in a folder of its own, so create a new component folder, `Create Person Wizard`. Create three visual components in the folder called `Step 1`, `Step 2` and `Step 3`.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/folder-1.png)

</div>

You can now assign the components in the **Component Stack** in the `Add New Person Popup`. Click on it and set the components.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/component-stack-3.png)

</div>

It's probably time that we add a **Button** to open the **Popup**. Go back to the main App. Add a horizontally centered **Button** with the label `Add New Person`. Also give it some top margin seperate it from the list. Then add a new **Show Popup** node. Connect the **Click** signal from the **Button** to the **Show Popup** signal **Show**. Also make sure to select the **Add New Person Popup** as the component to show.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/list-1.png)

</div>

Make sure the **Button** opens up the **Popup**.

Now let's work on the data part of the Wizard. We want to start by creating a new **Object** that we can fill out with data as the wizard progresses. In the `Add New Person Popup` we add a **Create New Object** node. We want to trigger the creation of the **Object** when the **Popup** is created. However we are not exposing the **Did Mount** signal on our `Popup Base` component, so we need to do that first. Open the `Popup Base` component, add a new property `Did Mount` on the **Component Outputs** and connect it to the **Did Mount** signal of the root **Group**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/popup-base-1.png)

</div>

We can now connect the `Did Mount` signal from the `Popup Base` component to the **Do** signal of the **Create New Object** node in the `Add New Person Popup`, creating a new **Object** once the **Popup** opens.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-2.png)

</div>

## Sharing data betweem components in a **Component Stack**

This new **Object** is the one we will fill with data in the Wizard, so we need to be able to access it in our different subcomponents, `Step 1`, `Step 2` and `Step 3`. We could store the **Id** of the **Object** in a [Variable](/nodes/data/variable/variable-node) but an even neater solution is to use a [Component Object](/nodes/component-utilities/component-object). While **Variables** are global, the **Component Object** is only available to the children (and sub children) of the component where it resides, so there is no risk that someone accidently changes it where it shouldn't.

:::tip
The components on the **Component Stack** are considered children of the **Component Stack**, hence using **Component Objects** as a way to share data between different components on the **Component Stack** is often a good idea.
:::

So in the `Add New Person Popup`, create a **Component Object**. Give it a property `New Person Object Id`. Then connect the **Id** of the **Create New Project** to the new property of the **Component Object**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-3.png)

</div>

We can now start creating our simplr form in the first component, `Step 1`. First, lets get our newly created **Object** set up. This time we use the [Parent Component Object](/nodes/component-utilities/parent-component-object) to retrieve it. Make sure to add the same property as before `New Person Object Id`. Then we can connect it to the **Id** of an **Object** node to retrieve the **Object**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-1-1.png)

</div>

So let's add three [Text Input](/nodes/ui-controls/text-input) fields (for first name, last name and age). Hook them up to the **Object** (by adding the properties `firstname`, `lastname` and `age` - the last one being a number input only **Text Input**). Also add two **Buttons** one for "Cancel" and one for "Next" in a horizontal layout in a **Group**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-1-2.png)

</div>

## Sending events to communicate outside the **Component Stack**

Left to do on this screen is to store the content of our **Text Inputs** in the **Object** once the user clicks "Next" and then go to the next step, `Step 2`. We also need to handle the "Cancel" click. Let's start with the latter.

When the user clicks "Cancel" we want to close the **Popup** but we have to do **Close Popup** in the component that was opened directly using a **Show Popup** (i.e. the `Add New Person Popup`). How do we notify that component that the user clicked "Cancel"? Again, since the component that's on top of the **Component Stack** can be seen as a child to the stack, we can [Send an Event](/nodes/events/send-event) to the parent component (for a dedicated guide on **Events**, see [here](/docs/guides/business-logic/events)).

So add a **Send Event** node and give the channel name `Cancel Add Person`. Make sure it's only directed towards the parent.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/event-1.png)

</div>

Then trigger **Send** when the user clicks "Cancel".

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-1-3.png)

</div>

Go back to the `Add New Person Popup`. We need to add a [Receive Event](/nodes/events/receive-event) node here to react to the event. Make sure the `Cancel Add Person` channel is set. Also consume the event (set it to `Always`) to avoid the event propagating the tree - it's not needed beyond this component. Add a **Close Popup** node. Then we trigger the **Start Close Transition** signal on the `Base Popup` (to start the close transition) and then when the transition is done (the **Close Transition Done** signal is triggered), we trigger **Close** on the **Close Popup Node**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-4.png)

</div>

## Pushing and replacing components on the **Component Stack**

Ok, now let's go back to the `Step 1` component to finish it off. First, we need to save the content of the **Text Inputs** in the **Object**. We do this by adding a **Set Object Properties** node, add our three properties (`firstname`,`lastname`, `age`). Also, don't forget to set the **Id** to the same **Id** we got from our **Parent Component Object**. Then we connect the **Click** signal on the "Next" **Button** to the **Do** signal on the **Set Object Properties**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-1-4.png)

</div>

After saving we need to move to the `Step 2` component. Add a **Push Component To Stack** node. When you click on it, you can see a number of options. We see that it's using our `Main` (if we had more than one **Component Stack** in our project we would have to select the right one here). First let's change the **Target Component** to `Step 2 - Country`. We also see the **Mode** property. Here you can select **Push** or **Replace**. Since we want to be able to let the user go back in the Wizard in the each step, we probably want to keep **Push** as the mode. Essentially each component will be stacked on top of each other, and we can use the **Pop Component Stack** to go back to the previous component on the stack.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/push-component-1.png)

</div>

We should trigger the **Navigate** signal on the **Push Component To Stack** when the data is stored, using the **Done** signal.

## Tweaking Transitions

Try out the navigation to the next step. You will see that the **Dark Overlay** option in the **Push Component To Stack** makes it looks weird so untick that option. Feel free to play around more with the transitions. Maybe change the **Shift Transition** to 100% to make it look more like a proper transition. You will see that it's important the the containing **Group** node clips its children for the transition to work. In the `Popup Base` component, that is the second **Group** that holds the **Component Children**.

## Editing `Step 2`

This will be a simpler form, containing a [Radio Button Group](/nodes/ui-controls/radio-button-group) with our country options. So let's add it in, together with three [Radio Buttons](/nodes/ui-controls/radio-button). We only have three options in this case, `England`, `Scotland` and `Ireland`. Make sure both **Label** and **Value** of the **Radio Buttons** are set to the respective value. Also add a sub title that says `Pick Country`. Finally, add two buttons at the bottom `Back` and `Next`. We can copy/paste them from the previous step and just change the title of the first **Button**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-2-1.png)

</div>

## Popping from the **Component Stack**

We start by adding in a **Pop Component Stack** node. As you can see you can send results back in a similar way as the **Close Popup** (**Results** and **Back Actions**). In this case we don't have any data to pass. Instead just connect **Click** from the "Back" button to **Navigate**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-2-2.png)

</div>

As you can see, popping from the stack plays the push transition, but in reverse. We can see that having different sizes of our components is a little bit annoying since the popup changes size dynamically as they are shown and hidden. Let's fix that by having a fixed size on the components `Step 1`, `Step 2` and `Step 3`.

We do this by going to our `Add New Parson Popup` and move in a new **Group** with a fixed size (250px / 300 px) as a parent to the **Component Stack**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-5.png)

</div>

While we see that there is still a little layout-tweaking to be done (the buttons at the bottom moves around, etc). Let's fix that quickly. We want to make sure the buttons are always at the bottom of the screen. So find the **Group** containin the **Buttons** for `Step 1` and `Step 2`. Make sure to remove the **Margin** of the **Group**, or it will compete with the alignment, and then align it at the bottom.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/group-alignment.png)

</div>

Great, now the buttons stay at the bottom!

Instead we want to add `Step 3` to the **Component Stack** when the user clicks "Next" in Step 2. We also need to pass on the selected country. We could of course store it in our **Object** but as you can see in the data model above, the country is not stored seperately. Instead we want to pass it on to `Step 3`. We could store it in the **Component Object**, as before, but in this case we can make use of the **Component Inputs** of the component to be opened.

Go to `Step 3` and add in a **Component Inputs** node. Add the port `Country`.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-1.png)

</div>

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/comp-input-1.png)

</div>

## Forwarding data to a component on the stack using **Component Inputs**

Now, if you go back to `Step 2`, and add in a **Push Component To Stack** and select `Step 3` as the target (also fix the transition as before), you will se that there is a new input called `Country`. We can connect the **Value** of the **Radio Button Group** to the `Country` input. Also connect **Click** on the "Next" **Button** to **Navigate** on **Push Component To Stack**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-2-3.png)

</div>

Great! Let's move to `Step 3` then. Here we want to display options of cities depending on which country that was selected. Let's create a **Static Array** (set to JSON format) with the following data:

```json
[
  { "city": "Bristol", "country": "England" },
  { "city": "Hartlepool", "country": "England" },
  { "city": "Newcastle", "country": "England" },
  { "city": "Wigan", "country": "England" },
  { "city": "Kilkenny", "country": "Ireland" },
  { "city": "Dublin", "country": "Ireland" },
  { "city": "Cork", "country": "Ireland" },
  { "city": "Galway", "country": "Ireland" },
  { "city": "Glasgow", "country": "Scotland" },
  { "city": "Edinburgh", "country": "Scotland" },
  { "city": "Dundee", "country": "Scotland" },
  { "city": "Kildrummy", "country": "Scotland" }
]
```

We want to present a **Radio Button Group** with only the valid cities for the country that was selected in the previous step. So let's start with an [Array Filter](/nodes/data/array/array-filter).

Add a filter on the property `country`.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/array-filter-1.png)

</div>

Make sure it's of the **Equals** type (and a String).

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/array-filter-2.png)

</div>

Then connect **Items** of the **Static Array** to the **Items** of the **Array Filter**. Then connect the `country` output of the **Component Inputs** to the **Value** of the country filter.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/array-filter-3.png)

</div>

Add an **Array** to have a look at the results. We can now see that only the items that matches the country is filtered out. Nice!

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-2.png)

</div>

Now we need to visualize the option in a list, using a **Radio Button Group**, **Repeater** and **Radio Button**. Start by creating the list item. Call it `Step 3 List Item`. It should look like below:

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-list-item-1.png)

<CopyToClipboardButton
  json={{
    nodes: [
      {
        id: '5d3f90ec-abf3-7473-b43f-935e02141387',
        type: 'Group',
        x: -163,
        y: -64,
        parameters: { height: { value: 30, unit: 'px' } },
        ports: [],
        children: [
          {
            id: '331e1282-31df-46ad-73ca-69ba2b03f4bc',
            type: 'net.noodl.controls.radiobutton',
            x: -143,
            y: -18,
            parameters: { alignY: 'center' },
            ports: [],
            children: [],
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        id: 'b62673b4-2625-d20c-f473-81b537b7cc54',
        type: 'Model2',
        x: -575,
        y: -92,
        parameters: { properties: 'country,city', idSource: 'foreach' },
        ports: [],
        children: [],
      },
      {
        id: '65ebe7fd-a47d-9edc-8e6d-dac435066879',
        type: 'String Format',
        x: -343,
        y: 67,
        parameters: { format: '{city}, {country}' },
        ports: [],
        children: [],
      },
    ],
    connections: [
      {
        fromId: 'b62673b4-2625-d20c-f473-81b537b7cc54',
        fromProperty: 'prop-city',
        toId: '331e1282-31df-46ad-73ca-69ba2b03f4bc',
        toProperty: 'label',
      },
      {
        fromId: 'b62673b4-2625-d20c-f473-81b537b7cc54',
        fromProperty: 'prop-city',
        toId: '65ebe7fd-a47d-9edc-8e6d-dac435066879',
        toProperty: 'city',
      },
      {
        fromId: 'b62673b4-2625-d20c-f473-81b537b7cc54',
        fromProperty: 'prop-country',
        toId: '65ebe7fd-a47d-9edc-8e6d-dac435066879',
        toProperty: 'country',
      },
      {
        fromId: '65ebe7fd-a47d-9edc-8e6d-dac435066879',
        fromProperty: 'formatted',
        toId: '331e1282-31df-46ad-73ca-69ba2b03f4bc',
        toProperty: 'value',
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

</div>

The **Object** has two properties `country` and `city` and gets its **Id** from the **Repeater**. Also note that the **Value** of the **Radio Button** is using a **String Format** (with the string `{location}, {city}`) to construct the final location string that matches the data model (for example `Dublin, Ireland`).

Then we go back to `Step 3` component and add in a **Radio Button Group** and a **Repeater** (using our new `Step 3 List Item`) and then feed it with data. With some margin tweaking it will look something like below.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-3.png)

</div>

Ok, we continue by copying and pasting the **Buttons** from the previous step (we should really make these into a re-usable component!). Let's also bring the **Pop Component Stack** node as well (connected to the "Back" button) as we need one in this step as well.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-4.png)

</div>

## Saving the created **Object**

Ok we are almost done with our wizard. We need to save the location to the **Object** containing the info on the new person. We do it in the same way as in the `Step 1` component, we use a **Parent Component Object** to retrieve the **Object** that was created in the **Popup**. This time we store the **Value** of the **Radio Button Group** in a property called `location` We store the value when the user clicks "Next".

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-5.png)

</div>

Finally we need to let the `Create New Person Popup` know that the **Object** is filled out when the user clicks "Next" on the last stage. Again, we do that by sending an **Event** this time with the **Channel Name** `Confirm Add Person`, send it to **Parent**. We do that once the **Set Object Properties** is done.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/step-3-6.png)

</div>

## Passing data from the **Popup**

We go back to our `Add New Person Popup` to receive the event. Add in a **Receive Event Node** receiving from the channel `Confirm Add Person`.

### Event logic

We are going to need some extra logic here. Since both the `Cancel Add Person` and `Confirm Add Person` will trigger the close transition of the popup we need to be able to distinguish the two cases one the transition is ready. Because, in the `Confirm Add Person` case we want to pass the created **Object** to the main App, so it can be added to the list of People.

We add in a **Switch** node, that's only set to true if the `Confirm Add Person` event is received. The, once the transition is closed, we use a **Condition** node to test the value of the **Switch**. Depending on the case (i.e. **onTrue** or **onFalse** from the **Condition** node) we trigger two different **Close Actions** on the **Close Popup** node (`Confirm` or `Cancel`). We also make sure to pass the **Id** of the **Object** representing the person in a result called `New Person Object Id`.

Here's how the whole thing looks.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/add-new-person-6.png)

</div>

## Adding the **Object** to the **Array**

Now we need to receive the **Object** in our main App. We will get it through the `New Person Object Id` and add it if we get the `Confirm Add Person` signal from the **Popup**. We use the **Insert Object into Array** node to add it.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/navigation/component-stack/list-2.png)

</div>

Try it out, we can now add new persons to our list using our little Wizard in a popup!

## Reading which component is on top of the **Component Stack**

In our Wizard we still have our text `Step x of 3`. We want to make that work. Go back to the `Add New Person Popup`. The **Component Stack** has an output called **Top Component Name** that will hold the name of the component that's currently on top Note that it's the name of the component in the **Component Stack**, not the component that's used to represent it. So in out case it will be `Step 1 - Name`, `Step 2 - Country`, `Step 3 - Location`. If we somehow could transfor this to the number 1,2 or 3, we can just feed it into our **String Format**. What might be an even easier solution is to use the **Stack Depth** property. Since we use **Push** rather than **Replace** our **Component Stack** will grow in size from 1 to 2 to 3, which is exactly what we want. So we connect it to the **String Format** node.

## Making sure the data is filled out

We are almost done. There are many ways to improve this wizard but one obvious thing is that we want users to be forced to select something before moving to the next step. For example not selecting a country will mess up `Step 3`.

In `Step 1` we can look at the length of the **Text** value coming out of the **Text Input** nodes. We use the **String** node which has a **Length** output. We connect these three length values to an expression that makes sure all three of them are greater than zero (using the expression `a>0&&b>0&&c>0`). Then we connect the **Result** of that expression to the **Enabled** input of the "Next" **Button**.

In `Step 2` and `Step 3` we essentially do the same, but we look at the length of the **Value** of the **Radio Button Group**.

We are done! We have a small wizard in a Popup to fill information when adding new persons!
