# Using Variables

## What you will learn in this guide

In this guide you will learn how to use the [Variable](/nodes/data/variable/variable-node) node and the [Set Variable](/nodes/data/variable/set-variable) node to store data in your application for later use. Variables are _local_ meaning they will not be stored in a persistent database. They are very useful to store data and states that applies to a usage session of an app or a screen.

## Overview

The guide covers the following topics

-   Setting variables
-   Reading variables
-   Accessing variables globally
-   Using variables with conditions

## When to use Variables?

When developing an app, you often run into the situation that you need to hold on to a value - a piece of data - and use it at a different place in your app.

For example, you may have a [TextInput](/nodes/ui-controls/text-input) where the user can input their name. You want the name first letter of the name to be always capitalized, no matter what the user inputs it. This name should be used through out the App. Hence you would like to store it so you can retrieve it on various places in the app.

You cannot really make a connection directly from the **TextInput** node to all the places where the name will be used. First of all, there might be too many of those connections. Second of all, the nodes that need the name are maybe not in the same component so you can't really reach them. And lastly, you don't want the intermittent name, while the user is entering it, you only want it when the user is done, and then you want it with a capital first letter and not exactly how the user wrote it. This is use one case of many, where a Variable comes in handy.

## Storing and reading variables

Let's start by opening a new project. You can base it on the Hello World template. Then add a **TextInput** node. Change its' label to "Name". You may want to add a little bit of padding to the parent container as well, to make sure the **TextInput** get some air around itself.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

</div>

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/screen-1.png)

</div>

Now we are going to do two things. 1. We want to store the value of the TextField in a **Variable** node when the user hits _Enter_. 2. We also want to capitalize the first letter of the name, before we store it.

Let's start with the capitalization. Add a [Function](/nodes/javascript/function) node. Edit the script and paste the following:

```js
if (Inputs.name !== undefined) {
    Outputs.capitalizedName =
        Inputs.name.substr(0, 1).toUpperCase() + Inputs.name.substr(1)
}
```

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/function-1.png)

</div>

It's not important right now that you understand exactly how the Javascript works, but it will capitalize the first letter of what you feed into the **Function** node and set it on the output named `capitalizedName`.

Connect the **Text** output from the **TextInput** node to the **name** input on the newly created **Function** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-2.png)

</div>

### Setting a Variable

Ok so let's store the capitalized name in a **Variable**. To do this, add a **Set Variable** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-3.png)

</div>

### The Variable Name

Each variable need a **Name**. Any **Variable** or **Set Variable** node anywhere in your App that has the same **Name** will refer to the same actual data. The **Name** is case sensitive, and we are going to pick the name `userName`.

We will also set the type of the **Variable** to a **String**. This is important, for example, if the user chooses a username which are only numbers. With the **String** type set, we know even in that case, what's stored in this **Variable** is a **String**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/panel-1.png)

</div>

Then connect the `capitalizedName` output from the **Function** node to the **Value** input of the **Set Variable** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-4.png)

</div>

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-5.png)

</div>

We have one more thing we need to do to actually store the value in the **Variable**. We need to trigger the **Do** signal in the **Set Variable** node. This makes it possible for us to control exactly what we save. Again, as the user is typing in the **TextInput** the `capitalizedName` output will keep updating (try it!) and we only want to save once the user press _Enter_.

So, connect the **onEnter** output on the **TextField** to the **Do** input signal on the **Set Variable** and we are done with storing data in a **Variable**.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-6.png)

</div>

### Reading a Variable

Ok, now we want to use the value we just stored. We want to include the name in the `Hello World` greeting. So lets first add a [String Format](/nodes/string-manipulation/string-format/) node. Make sure the text in the node is "Hello World `{name}`".

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-7.png)

</div>

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/panel-2.png)

</div>

The **String Format** node now should have an input called **name**.
Create a **Variable** node. Make sure its' name is `userName` (it should pop up as a suggestion when you click the **Name** input in the panel), just as before. This **Variable** node will now refer to the same **Variable** as we were storing before.

Connect the **Value** output of the **Variable** to the **name** input of the **String Format** node. Finally, connect the **Formatted** output from the **String Format** node to the **Text** input on the **Text** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-8.png)

</div>

Now test your app. Start writing a name in the **Text Input**, press _Enter_ and you should see the "Hello World"-text changing.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/screen-2.png)

</div>

## Accessing Variables Globally

Now let's change the structure a little. We will create a **Popup** and present the "Hello World" message in it only after the user have pressed _Enter_.

:::note

If you want to learn more about popups, take a look at the [Popups](/docs/guides/navigation/popups) guide.

:::

Start by creating a new visual component, call it "Hello Popup".

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/create-popup-component-1.png)

</div>

This will become our popup. In the new component. Change the size so it takes up 80% of the width and 50% of the height. Make it's layout "Absolute". Align it in the center. Also change the color to a nice color, perhaps blue.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/popup-panel-1.png)

</div>

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/popup-panel-2.png)

</div>

Now, we want to move the **Text** node and the nodes feeding it with the text from the App component to the popup. Go back to the "App" component and selecte all nodes. Then copy them (Ctrl+C/Cmd+C). Go back to the "Hello Popup" component and paste the nodes.

Remove all nodes except the **Text** node, the **String Format** node and the **Variable** node. Then drag in the **Text** node so it becomes the only child of the **Group** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-9.png)

</div>

Then remove the same nodes from the "App" component.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-10.png)

</div>

We have now moved the "Hello World" text into a Popup. So let's open the Popup using the [Show Popup](/nodes/popups/show-popup) node. Create the node and connect the **Done** signal from the **Set Variable** node to the **Show** signal on the **Show Popup** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-11.png)

</div>

Also make sure the component that's being shown as a popup is the "Hello Popup".

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/popup-panel-3.png)

</div>

To back up for a second; what we have done now is to set the Variable `userName` when the user hits _Enter_. When the Variable have been set (the **Done** signal) we open a Popup with a new component. The component access the same Variable and shows the "Hello Message".

Before trying it, we should probably make it possible to close the popup.

In the "Hello Popup" component. Add a [Close Popup](/nodes/popups/show-popup) node and connect the **Click** signal from the parent group to the **Close** signal.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-12.png)

</div>

As you can see from this example, Variables are available in any component in your App.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/screen-3.png)

</div>

## Using Variables with Conditions

A very useful way to use Variables is when you want your App to show different things depending on certain conditions. For example, if the user enters a name that's too short, you want the text to ask them to pick another name. Otherwise you want to show the Hello message.

The general pattern is the following: Have a Variable that holds the final value to be used by a component (in this case a text to be shown by a **Text** node). Then use a [Condition](/nodes/utilities/logic/condition) to trigger two different **Set Variable** nodes, depending on the condition. The pattern is outlined below.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/pattern-1.png)

</div>

So let's try it on our example. We want to check for the case when the user name is less than 6 characters and ask the user to enter a new and longer name.

So using the pattern above we introduce a new **Variable** in the "Hello Popup". Let's call it `popupText`. We connect its value to the text node and remove the old connection.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-13.png)

</div>

Now we need to check the length of the provided name. This is easy using a combination of a [String](/nodes/data/string) node, an [Expression](/nodes/math/expression) node and a [Condition](/nodes/utilities/logic/condition) node.

Connect the **value** output from the **Variable** `userName` to the a **String** node. There is an output from the **String** called **Length** which holds the length (i.e. number of characters) of the string.

Then create an **Expression** node. We want to check that the length of the name is 6 characters or more. So edit the expression and write

```js
length >= 6
```

<div className="ndl-image-with-background">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/expression-1.png)

</div>

The expression node should now have an input called **length**. Connect the **Length** output from the **String** node to that input.

Finally connect the **Result** output to the **Condition** input of a **Condition** node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-14.png)

</div>

The **Condition** node has two signal outputs, **on True** and **on False**. We will use these signals to either set the previous "Hello World" string, or the warning string about the too short name. Let's set it up using a **String** node with a predefined error string and the **Set Variable** nodes we used before.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/docs/guides/data/variables/nodes-15.png)

</div>

Try it out with a few different names and see that it works. You may have to tweak the layout of the text to make it look nicer.
